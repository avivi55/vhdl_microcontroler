just a course project in vhdl. (A microcontroler)

I used `GTKViewer` for unit testing.
but any ghw viewer can utilize the `.ghw` files.
Moreover, I use `ghdl` as the vhdl "compiler".


Still a newbie in vhdl, coding style is confused for me, especially in a case-insensitive language.

I tried to be as verbose as possible, to not confuse myself.
